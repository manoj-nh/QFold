- Our current methods to find a structure of a folded protein given an amino acid sequence is limited to making 'predictions' based on finding similar sequences in known structures.
- Finding the folded structure through simulating the folded structure rather than predict it can have a lot of applications, but this is not tractable to classical computers even for small proteins due to the exponential growth of the confirmation space and the number of interaction terms.
- This is where Quantum Computing is promising!
